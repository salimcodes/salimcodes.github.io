							<h2 id="about_me">About Me</h2>
							<p>Hello! I'm Salim Oyinlola, an Undergraduate student at Cornell University (Cornell Tech) studying Electrical and Computer Engineering. I recently graduated from Brown University with a degree in Physics (Sc.B) and Applied Mathematics (A.B).</p>
                            <p>I am interested in key questions such as <strong>how to best represent scientific data</strong> and <strong>how to modify model architectures by leveraging physical laws or novel learning strategies</strong> to improve their applicability to problems in the natural sciences. I have had several research experiences exploring these questions spanning materials science simulation development and scientific machine learning research in sustainable foods, drug-discovery, and mechanics. My research has a track record of being used to solve tangible problems in industry, academic, and startup settings.</p>
							<p>I am passionate about incorporating physical inductive biases and constraints into deep learning workflows to improve their scientific applicability. This summer, I worked as a deep learning research intern at <a href="https://www.aqemia.com/", style="color:#2986cc">Aqemia</a>, a Paris-based drug-discovery startup, where I designed a unique attention-based graph neural network that predicted likelihood of reaction synthesis of SMARTS reaction strings to accelerate the rate at which drug candidates are optimized. I was also a part of the <a href="https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/crunch/home", style="color:#2986cc">The Crunch Group</a> at Brown University where I investigated neural networks as function approximators to solve differential equations by integrating governing physical laws into their architectures. In addition to my experience with physically-motivated deep learning research, I have extensive experience using Density Functional Theory (DFT), an ab-initio quantum mechanical simulation technique, which I cultivated while studying the superconducting phase in 2D graphene systems as part of the <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/li-lab/#:~:text=In%20the%20low%20dimensional%20electronic,or%20few%20layers%20of%20atoms.", style="color:#2986cc">Low-Dimensional Electronics Lab</a> at Brown.</p>							
							<p>In the past, I have also worked with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/research-for-industry/", style="color:#2986cc">Research for Industry</a> group at Microsoft Research where I developed a multimodal machine-learning based approach to predict food protein digestibility to accelerate the development of alternative food proteins. More details about my research projects can be found <a href="#research", style="color:#2986cc">here</a>.</p>
							<p>In my free time, I love to create recipes for my friends, cook, play the bass, and sing. I also love film photography and you can find some of my photos <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anvi_film/", style="color:#2986cc">here</a>!</p>

									<dt, id="graphs"><strong>Filtering Synthesizable Reactions Using Graph Neural Networks [June 2023 - Aug 2023]</strong></dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Supervised by Jacques Boitreaud and Dr. Antoine Brochard, I undertook a project on automating the time-intensive process of screening synthetic feasibility of drug candidates to help the medicinal chemists in the company. The fundamental challenge with this project was to create an architecture that was robust enough to generalize to in-house testing data, which had a distribution shift compared to the USPTO-MIT training data. To address this problem, I wanted to create a context-informed and chemically-constrained model. I formulated and implemented a unique attention-based architecture that used reactant and product graphs with encoded reaction site masks, generated using substructure matching, to do so. By the end of the summer, my model was performing with a false positive rate less than 0.1, filtering out almost all of the same reactions as Dr. Nicolas George, the in-house medicinal chemist. The most rewarding part of this project was seeing the tangible impact my research could have, as my model ultimately accelerated the rate at which promising molecules were screened from hours to seconds.</p>                                  
									</dd>
									<dt, id="adapt"><strong>Neural Networks as Differential Equation Solvers [Oct 2022 - Present]</strong></dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Advised by Dr. Somdatta Goswami and collaborating with two other undergraduate students, I created a PINN to solve the 1D heat equation using a custom loss function that enforced the structure of the solution and its boundary condition behaviour. Optimizing this model’s performance involved investigating loss convergence, identifying poor learning of boundary conditions, and implementing adaptive regularization. This resulted in a reduced boundary loss by six orders of magnitude. Next, we shifted our focus to handling the increased computational cost of the 2D case. We explored low-rank decomposition using forward-mode auto differentiation to separate the PINN on a per-axis basis as a strategy to do so. The repository for this project is available <a href="https://github.com/philipladuca24/PINNs-Project", style="color:#2986cc">here</a>.</p>

									<dt, id="dft"><strong>Simulations and Superconductivity in 2D Graphene Systems  [June 2021 - May 2023]</strong></dt>
									<dd>
										<p>For my Honors Senior Thesis (available <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1669gMK1-oKZeCAvo3fPNsvqKb4e3pB7v/view?usp=sharing", style="color:#2986cc">here</a>), I worked at the interface of experiment and theory by applying ab-initio quantum mechanical simulations to investigate the mechanism behind the superconducting phase in 2D graphene systems.</p>
										<p>Supervised by Dr. Jia Li at Brown University's low-dimensional electronics lab, I built a nano-electronic device from graphene to measure its unique superconducting and magnetic properties at cryogenic temperatures. Building this device provided me experience with several innovative fabrication techniques like graphene exfoliation using scotch tape, nano-circuit design in DesignCAD Express, and electron beam lithography. I received an Undergraduate Teaching and Research Award to pursue this research.</p>
										<p>I then initiated a collaboration with the Department of Chemistry (PI: Professor Brenda Rubenstein) to better understand this graphene system theoretically. My contributions included implementing a program called TriCrystal (repository available <a href="https://github.com/anvibhagavathula/TriCrystal", style="color:#2986cc">here</a>) that generated the system’s structure, running baseline band structure, density of states, and Fermi surface calculations, and proposing a cluster-based technique to overcome limitations in modeling large systems using DFT. My thesis laid the groundwork for my advisors to continue studying this system using a combined approach, which they were awarded a DEPSCoR grant to do. An example of the computational structures I generated are shown below.</p>

									<dt, id="protein"><strong>Leveraging Machine Learning to Predict Protein Digestibility [June 2022 - August 2022]</strong></dt>
									<dd>
										<p>Advised by Dr. Sara Malvar and Dr. Ranveer Chandra at Microsoft Research, I developed a multimodal machine-learning based method to predict food protein digestibility, a value normally determined using extensive animal experimentation. To tackle this problem, I first created a 2000-point ground-truth protein property dataset that mapped features such as food nutritional information and protein sequence embeddings, extracted from a pre-trained transformer model, to digestibility coefficients. Then, I used Shapley value analysis to only select features that had established relationships to protein digestibility in the literature to train tree-based models on. We found that this biologically-interpretable dimensionality reduction was key in achieving the high accuracies our models did through an ablation study. We filed a provisional patent for this methodology and after the summer, I co-authored a paper summarizing our findings that is available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00625", style=“color:#2986cc">arXiv</a>. This paper has since then been revised further and submitted to npj Science of Food. The downstream impact of our results is the reduction of animal experimentation in the development of new food products.</p>
